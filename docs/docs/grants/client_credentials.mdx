# Client Credentials Grant

When applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user.

:::tip
The `refresh_token` grant is enabled by default
:::

:::warning
The client_credentials grant should only be used by clients that can hold a secret. No Browser or Native Mobile Apps should be using this grant.
:::

### Flow

The client sends a **POST** to the `/token` endpoint with the following body:

- **grant_type** must be set to `client_credentials`
- **client_id** is the client identifier you received when you first created the application
- **client_secret** is the client secret
- **scope** is a string with a space delimited list of requested scopes. The requested scopes must be valid for the client.

_Did you know?_ You can authenticate by passing the `client_id` and `client_secret` as a query string, or through basic auth.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="query-string" label="Query String">
      ```http request
      POST /token HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      grant_type=client_credentials
      &client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
      &client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
      &scope="contacts.read contacts.write"
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="basic-auth" label="Basic Auth">
      ```http request []
      POST /token HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Authorization: Basic MTpzdXBlci1zZWNyZXQtc2VjcmV0

      grant_type=client_credentials
      &scope="contacts.read contacts.write"
      ```
    </TabItem>

  </Tabs>
</details>

The authorization server will respond with the following response.

- **token_type** will always be `Bearer`
- **expires_in** is the time the token will live in seconds
- **access_token** is a JWT signed token and can be used to authenticate into the resource server
- **scope** is a space delimited list of scopes the token has access to
