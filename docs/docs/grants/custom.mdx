# Custom Grant ⚠️

To implement a custom grant, you may extend the `AbstractGrant` class.

:::warning

This is advanced usage. Make sure you understand the OAuth2.0 specification before implementing a custom grant.

:::

:::note Enable this grant

```ts
const customGrant = new MyCustomGrant(...);

authorizationServer.enableGrantTypes(
  [customGrant, new DateInterval("1d")],
);
```

:::

## Extending the CustomGrant class

Once you've implemented your custom grant you need to enable it in your `AuthorizationServer`.

```ts
export class MyCustomGrant extends CustomGrant {
  readonly identifier = "custom:my_custom_grant";

  ... // Implement required methods
}
```
